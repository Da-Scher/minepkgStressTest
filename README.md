# minepkgStressTest
This is a simple application to stress test minepkg on various platforms. Rewritten in go from a previous version that didn't do so well.  

## Arguments
Rigorous: --rig, --rec, -r -- Test literally every version of minecraft available.  
Categorically [default]: --cat, -c -- Test the latest patch version of every minor version of minecraft, if that patch fails repeat with the next latest patch.
